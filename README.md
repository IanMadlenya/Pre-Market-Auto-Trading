The pre-market trading session typically occurs between 8:00am and 9:30am EDT each trading day though for some stocks we often observe frequent movements much earlier, e.g. at 6:00am. Many investors and traders watch the pre-market trading activity to judge the strength and direction of the market in anticipation for the regular trading session. Pre-market trading activity generally has limited volume and liquidity, and therefore, large bid-ask spreads are common. Many retail brokers offer pre-market trading, but may limit the types of orders that can be used during the pre-market period -- Pre-Market, Investopedia, http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/premarket.asp
